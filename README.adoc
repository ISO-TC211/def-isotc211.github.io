== Introduction

The ISO/TC 211 Ontologies is used to publish ontologies
published by ISO/TC 211 standards.

This repository is used to build and deploy the
https://def.isotc211.org site.

This repository is jointly managed by ISO/TC 211 and Ribose.

== Operations

These sections describe how to operate and update the ontologies site.

=== Updating ontologies

Ontologies on this site are managed in the other Git repository: https://github.com/ISO-TC211/ontologies

Remember to push your changes to that repository -- not this current one!

=== Deploying the site

This site uses the https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] static site generator tool to convert `.adoc` source files into HTML for rendering online via GitHub Pages.

To bring the ontologies onto def.isotc211.org, you would usually:

. Go to https://travis-ci.com/ISO-TC211/def.isotc211.org

. Click on the "More Options" menu, then click on the "Trigger Build" button: +

. Click on "Trigger custom build" in the popup: +

You could always try clicking on this button to trigger a build -- there are no side effects!


== Development

The following sections are only for site development and
unnecessary for updating of the site.
