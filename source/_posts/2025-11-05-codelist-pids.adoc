Persistent identifiers for Codelists and Code Sets have been implemented using the `def.isotc211.org` namespace.

Shorter namespaces for the vocabularies have been implemented, for example, instead of:

`https://def.isotc211.org/19160/-1/2015/Address/AddressableObjectLifecycleStage`

we now have

`https://def.isotc211.org/common/AddressableObjectLifecycleStage`

The older, longer, forms still work, but they will redirect to the newer, shorter, forms.

All legacy Codelists are contained within module-named namespaces. For example, all Codelists in the `CI` module have `/CI/` in their namespace such as:

* `https://def.isotc211.org/CI/DateTypeCode`
* `https://def.isotc211.org/CI/OnLineFunctionCode`

All Codelists / Code Sets not in a named module, such as _DCPList_ and _Address Alias Type_, and all future Code Sets are in the `/common/` namespace, e.g.:

* `https://def.isotc211.org/common/DCPList`
* `https://def.isotc211.org/common/AddressAliasType`
* `https://def.isotc211.org/common/CountryCode`
