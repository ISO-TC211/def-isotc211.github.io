The ISO/TC 211's _GOM_ has worked with the https://www.ogc.org[OGC] to host many of the TC's standards' codelists as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web[Semantic Web] vocabularies using the OGC's reference data platform known as the https://defs.opengis.net/prez/['OGC Rainbow'].

_GOM_, officially the _Advisory Group 6, Group for Ontology Maintenance_ - has worked with the https://www.ogc.org[Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)] to take updated versions of standards' codelists that GOM has converted from their original XML into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework[RDF] data according to the https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/[SKOS] vocabulary data model and load them into the OGC Rainbow which then automatically generates different views of them, including web pages.

The long-standing proposed persistent web addresses for each codelist can now be resolved - clicked on like any URL - and they will redirect to the Rainbow's human-readable web page form of them.

For example, the widely used ISO19115-1's _Role Codes_ codelist is online at:
